# Weather-prediction-in-ML
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based weather prediction system using historical meteorological data. The model leverages Python and popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib to predict weather conditions like temperature, humidity, rainfall, or cloud cover.
